# Bingo!! Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for the landing page of the "Bingo!!" applications.

## About The Project

"Bingo!!" is a digital solution designed to modernize the traditional, in-person bingo experience. It replaces the need for a physical bingo machine and paper cards, allowing friends and family to play together in the same location using their mobile devices.

The ecosystem consists of two main applications:

1.  **Bingo!! (The Caller App):** This app serves as the digital bingo caller.
    *   Draws numbers for 75 or 90-ball bingo games.
    *   Announces numbers using a real, engaging voice with jokes and rhymes.
    *   Offers customization for game speed, voice, and language (English, Spanish, French).
    *   Allows users to record their own voice for a personalized experience.
    *   Supports casting the bingo board to an external screen or TV via AirPlay or cable.

2.  **Bingo Cards!! (The Player App):** This is the companion app for players.
    *   Provides digital bingo cards on a player's smartphone or tablet.
    *   Features automatic number marking as they are called by the main app.
    *   Includes a QR code scanning feature to instantly check if a card has a winning BINGO.

The goal is to provide a fun, interactive, and convenient way to play bingo in a group setting, without being an online multiplayer game.

### Key Features

*   **Full Customization:** Choose between 75/90 ball modes, adjust game speed, and select from multiple voices and languages.

*   **Instant QR Code Verification:** Scan a card's QR code with the main app to instantly confirm a BINGO.
*   **External Screen Support:** Display the main bingo board on a large screen for everyone to see.
*   **Engaging Audio:** Enjoy real voice announcements with jokes and rhymes, or record your own.
*   **Multi-language:** Fully localized in English, Spanish, and French.
